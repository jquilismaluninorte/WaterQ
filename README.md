## WaterQ

## Colombia IRCA Data Analysis

In this project, the analysis will be carried with the complete database for some municipalities of Colombia regarding water quality. Our goal is to do an analysis of the data existing in public data sources about water quality in Colombia and identify the main factors affecting the water quality results, allowing public organisms to have a wider knowledge about the problem so that they can deal with it more efficiently through public politics. We also include the information about mining extractions to find any relation between the data quality. And last but no least we provide a dashboard to help the final user of the information to navigate through the different tables, graphs and maps to take the best decision.
